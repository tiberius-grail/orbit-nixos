# fleet-nixos

Fleet Orbit and Fleet Desktop integration for NixOS, packaged as a Nix flake.

## Overview

This repository provides NixOS modules and packages for deploying [Fleet
Orbit](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/blob/main/orbit/README.md) and Fleet
Desktop on NixOS systems. It builds the latest releases from FleetDM’s GitHub,
applies custom patches for Nix compatibility, and exposes a flexible module for
configuration.

## Features

- **Packages**: Builds and provides `orbit` and `fleet-desktop` binaries.
- **NixOS Module**: Easily enable and configure Fleet Orbit and Fleet Desktop
  via `services.orbit`.
- **Systemd Integration**: Sets up system and user services for Orbit and Fleet
  Desktop.
- **Custom Patches**: Adds extra flags for NixOS compatibility (see below).
- **Update Script**: Automates updating to the latest Fleet Orbit release.

## Installation

1. **Add the flake as an input:**

   ```nix
   inputs.fleet-nix = {
     url = "github:adamcik/fleet-nixos";
     inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
   };
   ```

1. **Import the module in your NixOS configuration:**

   ```nix
   imports = [
     inputs.fleet-nix.nixosModules.fleet-nixos
   ];
   ```

## Configuration

Enable the service and configure options under `services.orbit`. **You must set
either `enrollSecret` or `enrollSecretPath`.**

### Example Configuration

```nix
services.orbit = {
  enable = true;
  fleetUrl = "https://your-fleet.example.com";
  # WARNING: use enrollSecretPath for secrets outside nix-store
  enrollSecret = "your-enroll-secret";
  debug = true;
  devMode = false;
  hostIdentifier = "uuid";
  enableScripts = false;
  fleetCertificate = "/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt";
  fleetDesktopAlternativeBrowserHost = null;
  fleetManagedHostIdentityCertificate = false;
  endUserEmail = null;
  insecure = false;
};
```

## Design Decisions

Some Orbit flags and environment variables are hardcoded or omitted for NixOS
compatibility:

- **Updates**: All update-related flags are omitted/hardcoded because NixOS manages packages declaratively. Orbit’s auto-update logic is disabled.
- **Keystore**: Always disabled for NixOS to avoid storing secrets in OS-specific keystores.
- **Paths**: State, logs, and osquery DB paths are hardcoded for security and consistency.
- **Channels**: Update channels are not exposed; updates are managed by Nix, not Orbit.
- **Deprecated/Platform-specific flags**: Omitted as not relevant for NixOS.
- **NixOS-specific flags**: Extra flags are added via patches to ensure correct binary usage, log placement, and Fleet Desktop integration.

## Systemd Services

- **systemd.services.orbit**: Runs the Orbit agent as a system service.
- **systemd.user.services.fleet-desktop**: Runs Fleet Desktop as a user service for graphical sessions.

NOTE: Orbit does not log everything to journald. Check `/var/log/orbit/` for logs.

## Patches

Patches in this repo add extra flags and functionality to Orbit for NixOS compatibility:

- `orbit-nixos.patch`: Patches Orbit's script execution to automatically replace common shebangs (like `#!/bin/bash`) with NixOS-style paths (`#!/run/current-system/sw/bin/bash`) before execution.
- `osqueryd-path-override.patch`: Adds `NIX_ORBIT_OSQUERYD_PATH` to allow overriding the `osqueryd` binary path, ensuring the version from the Nix store is used.
- `osquery-log-path.patch`: Adds `NIX_ORBIT_OSQUERY_LOG_PATH` to ensure osquery logs are written to `/var/log/orbit/osquery/` instead of the root directory.
- `scripts-nixos.patch`: Relaxes Orbit's shebang validation to allow NixOS-specific paths and `/usr/bin/env` interpreters in scripts.

These patches ensure that Fleet Orbit works correctly in the read-only and non-standard environment of NixOS.

## Development

### Running Checks

To run all checks (formatting and package builds) locally, use:

```shell
nix flake check
nix flake check ./dev
```

This is the same command used in CI to ensure the repository is in a good state.

### Cachix

CI pushes build outputs to the public `fleet-nixos` Cachix cache. The development
flake is configured to use it:

```nix
nixConfig = {
  extra-substituters = ["https://fleet-nixos.cachix.org"];
  extra-trusted-public-keys = ["fleet-nixos.cachix.org-1:WuxM+Kqv8GoWP+kTmxHBUk9qVXvjvrYzoG17LtqJ4xc="];
};
```

GitHub Actions requires `CACHIX_AUTH_TOKEN` to push to the cache.

When using direnv, use the development flake and accept its cache configuration:

```shell
use flake ./dev --accept-flake-config
```

### Formatting

This project uses `alejandra` for formatting Nix files. You can format the entire project with:

```shell
nix fmt ./dev
```

## Updating Fleet Orbit

To update to the latest Fleet Orbit release, run:

```shell
nix-update orbit --flake --use-update-script
```

This will update the version, commit, and date in `pkgs/default.nix`.

### Patch workflow

Patch files in `patches/` should be treated as exported commits from a Fleet
checkout, not hand-edited long-term.

1. Materialize a patch branch in `../fleet` from local patch files:

   ```shell
   ./import-patches.sh --base-tag orbit-v1.54.0 --branch orbit-nixos-patches
   ```

   This applies each `patches/NNNN-*.patch` file in lexical order and creates
   one commit per patch on top of the base tag.

2. Rebase that branch in `../fleet` onto a newer Orbit tag as needed.

3. Export the rebased commit range back into patch files:

   ```shell
   ./export-patches.sh --base orbit-v1.54.0 --head orbit-nixos-patches
   ```

   This writes `patches/NNNN-*.patch` (one per commit), where each filename is
   derived from the first line of the commit message.

This keeps patches reproducible and makes upstream churn easier to manage.

## Fleet Desktop

Fleet Desktop is enabled as a user service when Orbit is enabled. It uses the
same configuration and integrates with graphical sessions.

## Troubleshooting & Tips

- **Required**: You must set either `enrollSecret` or `enrollSecretPath`.
- **Debugging**: Set `debug = true` for verbose logs.
- **Secrets**: Use `enrollSecretPath` with sops-nix for secure secret management.
- **Logs**: Check `/var/log/orbit/` for logs.
